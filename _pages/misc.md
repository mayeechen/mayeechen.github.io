Outside of research, my hobbies and interests include dancing, fashion, food/travel, and ancient history and languages. At Stanford, I am a part of XTRM Kpop Cover Group and Alliance Dance Team. At Princeton, I was a member of Triple 8 East Asian Dance Company and Koko Pops Kpop Cover Group. Check out a few of the videos I've been in and choreographed below!
