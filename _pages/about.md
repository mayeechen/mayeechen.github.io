I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Christopher Ré](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/) and part of the [Hazy Research Lab](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/).

I'm interested in understanding the fundamental theoretical questions behind tools in modern machine learning and using them to develop new practical methods.
My current interests revolve around how to evaluate sources of supervision (e.g., weakly, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) throughout the ML pipeline and the role of misspecified inductive biases.
<!--More fundamentally, I have been working on developing efficient and robust estimators in latent variable models and understanding their finite-sample generalization error in different applications. 
I also enjoy learning about information theory, optimization, and probability theory.-->

Previously, I graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 2019 with a concentration in Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE) and a certificate in Applications of Computing.
I worked on my senior thesis on quantum machine learning with Prof. [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/) and completed junior independent work on modeling misinformation in social networks  with Prof. [Miklos Racz](https://mracz.princeton.edu/).
<!--My senior thesis, which was awarded the Ahmet S. Çakmak Prize, was on quantum computing with Professor Elad Hazan.
I also worked with Prof. Miklos Racz on understanding the spread of misinformation in social networks.
I took a broad range of courses in computer science, statistics and financial mathematics and completed internships in software engineering and quantitative finance.-->
